```elixir
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Enum.reduce(list, 0, fn x, acc ->
  if rem(x, 2) == 0 do
    acc + x
  else
    acc
  end
  # Missing the return statement here!
  # This will cause the reduce function to return the last evaluated expression in the if statement, not the accumulated value
  # resulting in incorrect sum
  
end)
```
